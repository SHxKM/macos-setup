# macOS setup

This is how I plan to set-up my new machine.

### Usage:

Supply your source and destination directories:

```bash
./install.sh /Users/username code/macos-setup/
```

Or call `./install.sh` and supply as prompted.

### To Do:

1. ~~Figure out order of operations (in an `install.sh` file)~~
2. Copy settings files to their appropreiate places
3. Make sure operations are safe
4. ~~Make sure dobrew.sh installs in the right directories~~

### Recent changes:

- `install.sh` now prompts for home directory and dotfiles directory if not given as `args`
